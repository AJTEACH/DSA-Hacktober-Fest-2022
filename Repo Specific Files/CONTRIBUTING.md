    Two ways to write: <br/>

  - Press dot on the main page of the forked repository on your account, `VS Code Web` will open and then write into it.<br/><br/>
- Once you are done writing, add the necessary files with `‚ûï button` in github or use `git add --all`.<br/><br/>
- Then commit the files using the `‚úî button` in vs code or use command `git commit -m "message"` command where in `message`, you will write a message about whatever you added.<br/><br/>
